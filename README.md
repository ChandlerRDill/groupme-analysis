# Groupme Analysis

Check out the live site at [https://groupmeanalysis.com](https://groupmeanalysis.com)!

This site was a side project of mine after I did this manually using GroupMe's API, and realized it could be turned into a much more automated and powerful tool.

The app runs using GroupMe's REST API, and then runs off of a combination of HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.

Simply add the bot with the corresponding phone number and name, and at the touch of a button your groupme will be analyzed, giving info like best comments, the people with the most likes, who likes you the most, who do you have the most in common with, etc.
